- Trending discussions displayed as cards
- "Idea Rooms" to add and filter ideas by stage and domain
- Knowledge Hub listing helpful resources
- "Build With Me" matchmaking based on interests
- Progress board for weekly milestones
- Youth Hub with mentor matchmaking and youth resources (see youth.html)
